                                The Citation V has a fine blend of cabin comfort, performance, and reliability. It is a
                                good
                                choice for short trips.
                                The deciding factor for most clients when comparing the Citation V to other similar jets
                                is
                                often the comfort of the cabin. The Citation V’s cabin is 17.4 feet long, 4.8 feet wide
                                and
                                4.8 feet high. Compare these numbers to the Hawker 400XP’s cabin dimensions of 15.6 x
                                4.8 x
                                4.9 feet, or the Citation Bravo’s dimensions of 15.8 x 4.7 x 4.8 feet – the difference
                                in
                                length is significant. The engineers of the Citation V took advantage of the extra cabin
                                space and installed extra-wide seats that recline 60 degrees and rotate a full 360
                                degrees.
                                The cabin pressurization system can hold a sea level cabin to 23,580 feet, which is
                                useful
                                when flying at a high speed (425 knots/hour) cruise at 37,000 feet, or at a long range
                                (350
                                knots/hour) cruise at the Citation V’s maximum certified flight ceiling of 45,000 feet.
                                Takeoff distances are fairly short. At sea level, the Citation V can take off in 3,160
                                feet.
                                At an altitude of 5,000 feet and a temperature of 77°F, the required runway distance
                                increases to 4,780 feet.
                                Pilots aren’t the only ones that can appreciate the performance capabilities of the
                                Citation
                                V. Its average cruise speed of 415 knots per hour makes it a popular choice for 350 to
                                400
                                mile trips. Typical nonstop flights include Fort Lauderdale to New York, Aspen to Los
                                Angeles, and San Francisco to Southern California.
                                The Citation V is known as a pilot-friendly jet, which also means an exceptionally safe
                                one.
                                Its pre-flight check is easy to carry out, with its organization designed with the
                                pilots in
                                mind. The jet handles well, especially in normal maneuvers and the landing approach
                                configuration. The cockpit visibility of 340 degrees is unmatched by any other light
                                private
                                jets in its class, and managers and mechanics alike have repeatedly praised its
                                reliability.
                                In short, the Citation V virtues are comfort, performance, and reliability. It comes as
                                no
                                surprise that it is consistently chosen over other private jets in its class.

                                The Citation V has a fine blend of cabin comfort, performance, and reliability. It is a

                                4.8 feet high. Compare these numbers to the Hawker 400XP’s cabin dimensions of 15.6 x

                                4.9 feet, or the Citation Bravo’s dimensions of 15.8 x 4.7 x 4.8 feet – the difference

                                length is significant. The engineers of the Citation V took advantage of the extra cabin
                                space and installed extra-wide seats that recline 60 degrees and rotate a full 360
                                degrees.
                                The cabin pressurization system can hold a sea level cabin to 23,580 feet, which is
                                useful
                                when flying at a high speed (425 knots/hour) cruise at 37,000 feet, or at a long range
                                (350

                                At an altitude of 5,000 feet and a temperature of 77°F, the required runway distance
                                increases to 4,780 feet.
                                Pilots aren’t the only ones that can appreciate the performance capabilities of the

                                mile trips. Typical nonstop flights include Fort Lauderdale to New York, Aspen to Los
                                Angeles, and San Francisco to Southern California.
                                The Citation V is known as a pilot-friendly jet, which also means an exceptionally safe

                                The Citation V has a fine blend of cabin comfort, performance, and reliability. It is a
                                good
                                choice for short trips.
                                The deciding factor for most clients when comparing the Citation V to other similar jets
                                is
                                often the comfort of the cabin. The Citation V’s cabin is 17.4 feet long, 4.8 feet wide
                                and
                                4.8 feet high. Compare these numbers to the Hawker 400XP’s cabin dimensions of 15.6 x
                                4.8 x
                                4.9 feet, or the Citation Bravo’s dimensions of 15.8 x 4.7 x 4.8 feet – the difference
                                in
                                length is significant. The engineers of the Citation V took advantage of the extra cabin
                                space and installed extra-wide seats that recline 60 degrees and rotate a full 360
                                degrees.
                                The cabin pressurization system can hold a sea level cabin to 23,580 feet, which is
                                useful
                                when flying at a high speed (425 knots/hour) cruise at 37,000 feet, or at a long range
                                (350
                                knots/hour) cruise at the Citation V’s maximum certified flight ceiling of 45,000 feet.
                                Takeoff distances are fairly short. At sea level, the Citation V can take off in 3,160
                                feet.
                                At an altitude of 5,000 feet and a temperature of 77°F, the required runway distance
                                increases to 4,780 feet.
                                Pilots aren’t the only ones that can appreciate the performance capabilities of the
                                Citation
                                V. Its average cruise speed of 415 knots per hour makes it a popular choice for 350 to
                                400
                                mile trips. Typical nonstop flights include Fort Lauderdale to New York, Aspen to Los
                                Angeles, and San Francisco to Southern California.
                                The Citation V is known as a pilot-friendly jet, which also means an exceptionally safe
                                one.
                                Its pre-flight check is easy to carry out, with its organization designed with the
                                pilots in
                                mind. The jet handles well, especially in normal maneuvers and the landing approach
                                configuration. The cockpit visibility of 340 degrees is unmatched by any other light
                                private
                                jets in its class, and managers and mechanics alike have repeatedly praised its
                                reliability.
                                In short, the Citation V virtues are comfort, performance, and reliability. It comes as
                                no
                                surprise that it is consistently chosen over other private jets in its class.

                kayaks, all the way
                to top of the line yachts that you can easily live in. The problem with the latter is that you need
                a very large dock to keep it
                in as well as the fact that you need to keep it maintained, but i think that if you can afford one,
                both wont be a issue.<br>
